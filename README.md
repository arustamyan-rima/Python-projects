# Python projects

This repository contains a collection of small Python projects, each focused on a specific functionality or problem. The projects are standalone scripts, each addressing a particular task or concept. A brief overview of each project is provided below:

## Anagram Checker
### Description
The Anagram Checker project focuses on determining whether two given words are anagrams. An anagram is a sequence of letters that can be formed by rearranging the letters of another word.

### Implementation
The script includes a function check_anagram(word_1, word_2) that checks whether two words are anagrams, ignoring case sensitivity. It also includes a list of word pairs to be compared for anagrams.

## Sequence Formation
### Description
The Sequence Formation project explores the concept of the Collatz sequence. The Collatz sequence is generated using a specific set of rules applied to a starting number until the sequence reaches 1.

### Implementation
The script includes two different approaches to generate the Collatz sequence for a given starting number. The implemented functions help compute the sequence without using recursion.

## Miscellaneous Functions
### Description
The Miscellaneous Functions section covers various small-scale functions, including counting vowels in a string, filtering elements from a list, reversing and truncating strings, finding the maximum value in a list, and calculating the median of a list.

### Implementation
Each function is self-contained, with clear implementation details and comments for better understanding.

## Data Manipulation
### Description
The Data Manipulation section includes functions for filtering integer values from a list, checking if values fall within a specific interval, extracting specific data from a list, and sorting data according to various criteria.

### Implementation
Each function is designed to perform a specific data manipulation task, with well-structured and commented code for easy comprehension.

## Telephone Book Management
### Description
The Telephone Book Management project involves a function to manage a telephone book dictionary. It supports adding entries to the dictionary and normalizing phone numbers based on the provided criteria.

### Implementation
The script includes functions for adding entries to a dictionary and normalizing phone numbers. It efficiently manages and manipulates the data within the telephone book.

## List Parsing
### Description
The List Parsing project aims to parse a list of strings into float values, with specific considerations for strings using commas as decimal separators. It collects unparsable strings in an error list.

### Implementation
The script includes a function to parse the list, convert strings into floats, and handle exceptions for strings with comma decimal separators. It collects any unparsable strings in an error list for further analysis.
